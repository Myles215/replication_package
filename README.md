Data and processing scripts for the paper "Comparing Apples and Oranges? The Influence of Java Profiler Choice on the Identification of Hot Methods for Genetic Improvement".

Each project was run by cloning the relevant branch of Gin (as specified in the paper), and running the profiler in a shell script along these lines:
projectnameforgin='disruptor'

    for i in {1..20}
    do
       java -Dtinylog.level=trace -cp ../../../gin-jdk9/gin/build/gin.jar gin.util.Profiler -r 1 -h ~/.sdkman/candidates/maven/current/ -p $projectnameforgin -d . -v 4.10.2 -o $projectnameforgin.Profiler_output_$i.csv  &> $projectnameforgin.Profiler_stdoutstderr_$i.txt
       # or for memory:
       # java -Dtinylog.level=trace -cp ../../../gin-jdk9/gin/build/gin.jar gin.util.MemoryProfiler -r 1 -h ~/.sdkman/candidates/maven/current/ -p $projectnameforgin -d . -v 4.10.2 -o $projectnameforgin.MemoryProfiler_output_$i.csv  &> $projectnameforgin.MemoryProfiler_stdoutstderr_$i.txt
    done


results/figures/ contains all the plots from the experiments, and text files containing the raw statistics. plotnaming.txt details the conventions we've used in naming them.

results/Rankings/ contains the scripts used to process the results and generate the figures.

results/projectname* contains the CSVs generated by the relevant profiler for a given project. "JFR" means JRF17. "Memory" means memory profiling, otherwise the data is for CPU profiling.
