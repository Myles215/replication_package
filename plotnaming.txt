project_plottype_plotname_profiler(s)_{CPU,MEM}

plotnames:

histogram_rboComparingProfilersForUnionMethods - distribution of rbo values (comparing method rankings) computed among all pairs of repeat runs of profiler1 and profiler2
histogram_rboComparingProfilersForIntersectionMethods - as above, but with rankings filtered to only methods appearing in every repeat run of profiler
histogram_rboComparingProfilersForMedianMethods - as above, but with rankings filtered to only methods appearing in at least half of the repeats run of profiler

histogram_rboWithinRepeatsForUnionMethods - distribution of rbo values (comparing method rankings) computed among all pairs of repeat runs of profiler
histogram_rboWithinRepeatsForIntersectionMethods - as above, but with rankings filtered to only methods appearing in every repeat run of profiler
histogram_rboWithinRepeatsForMedianMethodsHPROF - as above, but with rankings filtered to only methods appearing in at least half of the repeats run of profiler

histogram_methodCounts - frequency of individual method appearances across all repeat runs of profiler

scatter_meanRanksIntersection - mean ranks of methods appearing in all runs of first profiler vs their rank according to second profiler
scatter_meanRanksMedian - as above, but mean ranks of methods appearing in at least half of all runs of first profiler
scatter_top10MeanRanksMedian - as above but limited to the top 10 (might be fewer than 10 points because not all methods ranked by first profiler were also ranked by second)
scatter_top30MeanRanksMedian - as above but limited to the top 30

histogram_testCountsForMethodX - frequency of individual test appearances among tests identified for method ranked X
